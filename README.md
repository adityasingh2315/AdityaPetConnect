## 💡 Why I Built This

Many pets are in need of loving homes, and many families want to adopt responsibly. I built **AdityaPetConnect** to bridge this gap using technology. This project serves as a real-world portfolio piece, showcasing my skills in full-stack development, state handling, API design, file handling, and admin workflows.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing pet data, user forms, etc.
- Express.js – Backend API framework
- React.js – Frontend library for UI
- Node.js – Backend runtime
- Mongoose – MongoDB ODM
- Multer – File upload handling (pet images)
- Nodemailer – For sending email notifications
- CSS / Font Awesome – Frontend design & icons

## ✨ Features

✅ List a pet for adoption  
✅ Upload pet images  
✅ Adoption form for interested adopters  
✅ Admin panel to approve or reject requests  
✅ Status tracking: Pending, Approved, Adopted  
✅ Email notifications on pet submissions
